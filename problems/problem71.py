=============================

Longest Repeating Character Replacement
---------------------------------------

Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can
perform at most `k` operations on that string.

In one operation, you may choose any character of the string and change it to
any other uppercase English character.

Find the length of the longest substring containing all repeating letters which
can be found after performing the operations.
