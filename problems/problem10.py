Blind Curated 75 - Problem 10
=============================

Search in Rotated Sorted Array
------------------------------

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to
you beforehand.

You are given a target value to search for. If found in the array, return its
index, otherwise -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
