Blind Curated 75 - Problem 23
=============================

Word Search
-----------

Given a two-dimensional board and a word, find whether the word exists in the
board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where
adjacent cells are the ones neighboring either horizontally or vertically. The
same cell may not be used more than once per word.
