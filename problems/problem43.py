=============================

Number of Islands
-----------------

Given a two-dimensional grid of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the
number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the
grid are all surrounded by water.
