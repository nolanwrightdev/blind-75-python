Blind Curated 75 - Problem 45
=============================

Course Schedule
---------------

There are a total of _n_ courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.
Some courses have prerequisites. For example, to take course 0, you might first
have to take course 1, which is expressed as the pair: `[0, 1]`.

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, determine
whether it is possible for you to finish all _n_ courses.
