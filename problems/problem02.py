	While iterating through the input string, maintain 1) a window of adjacent
	characters which are all unique, and 2) a map of characters in the window to
	their positions therein. If a character which already exists in the window
	is encountered, record the size of the window, drop from the window all
	characters up to and including the prior occurence of the encountered
	character, and adjust the map accordingly.
